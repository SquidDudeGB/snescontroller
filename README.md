# SNES Multitap Device

This is the code I made for my Arduino board (ATmega32u4), it simulates 2 multitaps for the SNES console.


## How-to

1. You need to wire each SNES controller ports (or buy a 7pin plugs) to get this working: Latch, Clock, Data1, Data2, IO

2. You can directly solder the wires on the console port or use a 7pin plug/extension cables

3. On your board, you can use any pin, just make sure to setup it right on the code

4. Upload the code. Done(?)
